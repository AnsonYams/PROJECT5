Methods that stayed in Functions:
loadImages()
processImageLine()
getImages()
setAlpha()
load()
processLine()
parseBackground()
parseSapling()
parseDude()
parseFairy()
parseTree()
parseObstacle()
parseHouse()
These functions stayed in the Functions class because they were general methods that did not take in any specific class parameters and
they are mainly used for setting up and preparing the program rather than actually being used for making the program interactive

Ambiguous methods moved:
createDudeFull()
createDudeNotFull()
createFairy()
createSapling()
createStump()
createTree()
createObstacle()
createHouse()
These methods were ambiguous because they did not take in any specific class as a parameter. They also call the Entity constructor which creates the entity.
I ended up putting it in WorldModel because it made more sense for the WorldModel to know how to create an entity rather than the entity class creating itself.
The WorldModel class also holds methods like addEntity() and removeEntity() so it makes sense for it to also hold the createEntities methods.
